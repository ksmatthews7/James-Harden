<h1>Harden, on a roll, could be first to average 40 in more than 50 years</h1>
<h2>By Korey Matthews</h2>
<h3>
James Harden could become the first NBA player in over 50 years to average 40 points per game or more, and the second player in NBA history to do it at all. The Houston Rockets star is currently leading the league in points per game with 37.9. 
<br>
<br>One of the things that gives Harden a chance is that while he is averaging a career-high in points, he’s below his career averages in shooting. He’s currently only shooting 33.8% from three-point range, where he is a career 36.4% shooter.
<br>
<br>No player has averaged 40 points per game since Wilt Chamberlain averaged over 44 during the 1962-63 season. Chamberlain was arguably one of the greatest scorers of all time. The University of Kansas graduate is the only player in NBA history to average over 40 and 50 points in a season.
<br> 
<br>“It’s significant because we haven’t seen anyone handle the ball the way James Harden has,” said Andre Melton, the executive producer of The Flex Zone, a sports podcast. “To be in the same company as Wilt Chamberlain is something young men dream of.”
